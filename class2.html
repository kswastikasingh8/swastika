    <p id="1"> Global Warming </p>
    <p> Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. The term is frequently used interchangeably with the term climate change, though the latter refers to both human- and naturally produced warming and cooling phenomena. It is most commonly measured as the average increase in Earth's global surface temperature. </p>
